\chapter{Results and Evaluation} This chapter includes a comparison and analysis of results generated by the text encapsulation toolkit(here onwards referred to as 
TET). The auto generated extracts(one third of the document length) of fifty randomly selected news articles from test data, are analyzed in view of objectives listed in section ~\ref{ch1:obj}.
\section{Extraction of important units(sentences) in a given text}
In order to discover important locations of text units, the document, extract tuple were matched. The results obtained by comparing these tuples showed that the 
articles in the corpus tend to contain information rich text units at the top of the document as is clear from figure ~\ref{ch3:sp2}. 
Following is a chart depicting sentence location as tuple (paragraph number, sentence number) on the horizontal axis, and its frequency in the sample of fifty extracts
on the vertical axis. It can be clearly observed that first sentences of each paragraph is frequently extracted, however within the paragraph the contribution of subsequent
sentences is very low. The reason is explained in the next section.

\end{figure}
\section{Determine frequent subunits(phrases) in the given text}
If the extraction mechanism only utilized the position hypothesis and assigned more importance to sentences at the top of the document, useful sentences at document depth
might have been lost. To retain such sentences frequent subunits(i.e. proper noun phrases) were extracted. Sentences were assigned weight as explained in section ~\ref{ch4:pnphrase}. 
The extraction mechanism ignores sentences with zero proper noun weight. It can be observed from the table ~\ref{ch5:tblpn} that the average weight assigned to sentences
of paragraph farther from the top of the document is more than the ones at the top, therefore sentences located at the end of paragraph or at the end of the entire 
document has a fair chance to contribute to extracts as long as the length specified to generate the extract allows. However, if the length specified to generate extracts
is reduced to very few words (e.g. 20 words for a document containing 300 or more words) the sentences containing frequent proper noun phrases are truncated.
It can also be easily observed from table ~\ref{ch5:tblpn} that choice of single best sentence is not straight forward, since sentences located at the end of document
might have more weight on the basis of proper noun phrases but at the same time less position based weight.

\section{Parse extracted units containing frequent subunits for noun, verb, noun pattern}
Compression ratio(CR) is one of the quantitative measure used to test the output of summarizers, and sentence compression methods. Encapsulations for first sentences of
each news article in the sample data is evaluated for compression. Following formula is used to obtain compression ratio:-
\begin{displaymath}
  CR = (1 - (\frac{No\ of\ words\ in\ sentence}{No\ of\ words\ in\ encapsulation})) * 100
\end{displaymath}
Table ~\ref{ch5:CR} displays the classified results. It can be observed that compression ratio for 38 sentences out of 49 is above 50\%. However CR is not enough alone 
to evaluate result, encapsulation obtained should retain important information. In absence of standards to evaluate information retention, and time limitation
, an on-line survey consisting of thirteen sentences and their encapsulation was conducted. Thirteen participants scored encapsulated text for completeness of information.
The participants(graduate students of this institute) of the survey are proficient in English language.
From the result, listed under table ~\ref{ch5:Survey} it can be observed that there is general agreement on the encapsulation obtained by the system. Sentence number 13 
in table ~\ref{ch5:sentsur} is an example where encapsulation generated by the system would not completely represent the information. The reason for this degradation
is the contents of the sentence. If the contents of the sentence describe a law or an article of a constitution then dropping any of its phrases 
would result in unsatisfactory encapsulation.
